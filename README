# Mapbox practice exercise

### Task


Given you have your data represented as a series of Point Features in a GeoJSON, how would you implement the following:
* map the data clustered in a hexGrid (http://turfjs.org/docs/#hexGrid)
* add drill-down interaction:
    * clicking on a hexagon would make it disappear and at the same time
    * the underlying datapoints appear represented as circles


### Prerequisites

* Node.js 10+ (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* Mapboxgl access token (https://www.mapbox.com/)

### Setup & run

1. Open `config_sample.js` file in a text editor, change `<your_mapboxgl_accesstoken>` to your mapboxgl access token and rename the file to `config.js`
2. Open command prompt from app folder and run:
   `npm install`
3. After successful installation:
   `npm run start`
